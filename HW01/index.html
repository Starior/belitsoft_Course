    <h3>Who is a Front-End Developer?</h3>
    <p>A front-end developer is a versatile professional. They can implement layouts, build web applications, and if needed, learn the server side as well.</p>
    <p>The career path of a front-end developer usually starts with layout—the most logical and common path. First you learn HTML and CSS, then add JavaScript, libraries and frameworks. The future specialist also learns key concepts of the server side, is not afraid of preprocessors and build tools like LESS, SASS, GRUNT, GULP, and can work with the DOM, API, SVG, AJAX and CORS. Then all of this is refined with version control (Git, GitHub, etc.), graphic editors, CMS templates and an understanding of UI/UX principles.</p>
    <p>Soft skills also help: working with people and in a team, setting up an effective workflow and solving tasks in the best way.</p>
    <p>Knowledge of English is essential.</p>

    <h3>How to Become a Front-End Developer?</h3>
    <p>First, be realistic. Learning takes effort and discipline. Many beginners drop out at the stage of "I want to be a programmer and earn in dollars, but I didn't expect to study so much." The nature of programming and IT in general is constant self-education—that's both the challenge and the appeal. If that doesn't scare you—great! You have every chance to become a strong specialist.</p>
